2,must be a student to join food sharing app,my last interviewee told me that she would like it to be such that you have to add your friends on the food exchange app i was trying to think of other ways that could fix this safety concern i then asked if she would feel more comfortable if you had to be a student to join the app she said yes this feature would work by making it so that you had to enter your school email address to join and a confirmation email would be sent to you with a code that would be needed to make the app functional ,Safety,food;user
